# Rule-Based-Receipt-Digitization-with-OCR-Automating
In this project, we try to automate the process of receipt digitization by using the Tesseract OCR and rule-based approach to detect the different fields of the receipt.
eg: It's a rule-based approach so you have to change the rules based on different receipts ( I'm currently working on a deep-learning-based approach that  detect fields automatically )
eg: You have to download the OCR from this site :
https://sourceforge.net/projects/tesseract-ocr-alt/files/tesseract-ocr-setup-3.02.02.exe/download
